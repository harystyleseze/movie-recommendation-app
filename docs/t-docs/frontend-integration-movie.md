‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

The user wants me to focus on the frontend and implement movie discovery features. Let me analyze what needs to be done:

1. Movie Discovery Features to implement:

   - Search movies by title, genre, or year
   - Filter by rating, release date, and popularity
   - View detailed movie information
   - Get personalized recommendations

2. Approach:

   - Think, explore, and implement
   - Don't over-engineer
   - Keep it minimal and usable
   - Keep it robust and ensure best practice
   - Run build when done

3. Key directories mentioned:

   - /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend
   - /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src
   - /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/nginx

Let me start by exploring the current frontend structure to understand what's already there, then plan the implementation.

First, I should explore the frontend directory structure to understand the current setup.

‚è∫ I'll implement the movie discovery features on the frontend. Let me start by exploring the current frontend structure to
understand what's already there, then plan and implement the features systematically.

‚è∫ Bash(find /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend -type f -name "_.jsx" -o -name "_.js" -o -name "_.ts" -o -name
"_.tsx" | head -20)
‚éø /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/tailwind.config.js  
 /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/dist/assets/index-DPt2w7d9.js
/Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/node_modules/queue-microtask/index.js
‚Ä¶ +17 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

I see this includes node_modules files. Let me be more specific and look at the src directory.

‚è∫ Bash(find /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src -type f | head -20)
‚éø /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/App.tsx  
 /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/main.tsx
/Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/test/setup.ts
‚Ä¶ +17 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Good, I can see this is a React TypeScript frontend with:

- UI components using a component library structure (ui components in components/ui)
- Landing page components
- It uses Tailwind CSS (tailwind.config.js)
- It's a Vite-based React app (main.tsx)

Let me check the package.json to understand the tech stack better, then look at the current App.tsx to see what's already
implemented.

‚è∫ Read(~/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/package.json)
‚éø Read 50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Good! The tech stack is:

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Vite build tool
- React Router DOM for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Testing with Vitest

Now let me check the current App.tsx to see what's already implemented:

‚è∫ Read(~/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/App.tsx)
‚éø Read 21 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

I can see there are already some routes set up:

- Landing page
- Register/Login pages
- Dashboard page

Let me check if these components exist and what they look like to understand the current implementation:

‚è∫ Bash(find /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src -name "\*.tsx" | grep -E "(auth|dashboard)" | head -10)
‚éø /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/components/auth/RegisterPage.tsx  
 /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/components/auth/LoginPage.tsx
/Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/components/dashboard/RecentActivity.tsx
‚Ä¶ +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Good, the auth and dashboard components already exist. Let me start by creating a todo list to track the implementation of the
movie discovery features, then create the necessary components and functionality.

First, let me plan what needs to be implemented:

1. Movie Discovery Features:

   - Search movies by title, genre, or year
   - Filter by rating, release date, and popularity
   - View detailed movie information
   - Get personalized recommendations

2. Implementation approach:

   - Create a movies page/section with search and filter functionality
   - Create movie components (search, filters, movie cards, movie details)
   - Set up API service to communicate with backend
   - Add routing for movie discovery features
   - Implement state management for search/filter state

Let me start with the todo list and then implement step by step.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Let me start by creating the API service for backend communication. I need to check if there's already an API service or similar
structure in place first.

‚è∫ Bash(find /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src -name "_api_" -o -name "_service_" -o -name "_http_" | head
-10)
‚éø (No content)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

No existing API services found. Let me create the API service structure. First, I'll create the API service, then move on to the
movie components.

Let me update the todo list and start with creating the API service.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Let me create the API service first. I'll create a services directory and set up the API communication.

‚è∫ Bash(mkdir -p /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/services)
‚éø (No content)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now let me create the API service that will handle communication with the backend.
