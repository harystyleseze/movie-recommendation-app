âœ… Complete Authentication Flow Implementation

I have successfully implemented the complete user registration and login flow with proper navigation, validation, and backend
integration. Here's what has been accomplished:

ðŸŽ¯ Core Features Implemented:

1. Frontend Routing & Navigation:

- âœ… Added React Router with clean URL structure
- âœ… Updated all CTA buttons across landing page to navigate to auth pages
- âœ… Implemented proper navigation flow: Landing â†’ Register/Login â†’ Dashboard

2. User Registration Page (/register):

- âœ… Complete form with validation (name, email, password, confirm password)
- âœ… Client-side validation with real-time error feedback
- âœ… Password strength requirements (8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- âœ… API integration with proper error handling
- âœ… Success redirect to login page with confirmation message

3. User Login Page (/login):

- âœ… Clean login form with email/password validation
- âœ… API integration with proper error handling
- âœ… JWT token storage and user data persistence
- âœ… Success redirect to dashboard with welcome message

4. Dashboard Page (/dashboard):

- âœ… Protected route with authentication checking
- âœ… User profile display and account information
- âœ… Welcome messages and success feedback
- âœ… Logout functionality with cleanup
- âœ… Responsive design matching the app's theme

5. Backend Integration:

- âœ… Frontend proxy configuration pointing to localhost:5001
- âœ… CORS properly configured for frontend-backend communication
- âœ… API endpoints working: /api/v1/auth/register and /api/v1/auth/login
- âœ… MongoDB database connected and user data persisting

6. Security & Best Practices:

- âœ… Proper form validation on both client and server
- âœ… JWT token authentication
- âœ… Secure password requirements
- âœ… Protected routes with redirect to login
- âœ… Clean localStorage management
- âœ… Proper error handling throughout

ðŸš€ Services Running:

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 âœ…
- Backend: http://localhost:5001 âœ…
- MongoDB: localhost:27017 âœ…

ðŸ”— User Flow:

1. Landing Page â†’ User clicks "Get Started Free" or "Sign In"
2. Registration â†’ User creates account â†’ Redirected to login with success message
3. Login â†’ User enters credentials â†’ Redirected to dashboard with welcome message
4. Dashboard â†’ Protected area showing user info and next steps
5. Logout â†’ Cleans tokens and redirects to landing page

âœ¨ Technical Excellence:

- Consistent Architecture: Following existing codebase patterns and design system
- Proper Error Handling: User-friendly messages for all failure scenarios
- Responsive Design: Works across desktop and mobile devices
- TypeScript Integration: Full type safety throughout
