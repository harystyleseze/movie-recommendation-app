Now I understand the current state:

- It's a basic Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- Very minimal - just the default boilerplate
- No additional UI frameworks or styling
- Only basic React dependencies

Let me start implementing this step by step:

1. First, I'll set up shadcn/ui
2. Structure the folders properly
3. Create the landing page components
4. Implement all the sections requested

Let me start with setting up shadcn/ui and the proper folder structure.

Let me try a different approach to initialize Tailwind. I can see that Tailwind 4.x was installed, which has a different
initialization process.

⏺ Write(~/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/tailwind.config.js)
⎿ Wrote 66 lines to ../frontend/tailwind.config.js
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} \*/
export default {
content: [
"./index.html",
"./src/**/\*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
],
theme: {
extend: {
colors: {
border: "hsl(var(--border))",
… +56 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

Now let me install the necessary shadcn/ui dependencies and set up the required tools.

⏺ Bash(cd ../frontend && npm install class-variance-authority clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react)
⎿ added 4 packages, and audited 199 packages in 5s

     51 packages are looking for funding
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⎿ Shell cwd was reset to /Users/user/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/backend

✻ Thinking…

Great! Now let me set up the proper CSS files and folder structure. I'll:

1. Update the index.css with Tailwind directives and CSS variables
2. Create the proper folder structure
3. Set up utility functions
4. Create components

⎿ File must be read first

✻ Thinking…

I need to read the file first, then edit it.

⏺ Read(~/Downloads/movie-recommendation-app/frontend/src/index.css)
⎿ Read 69 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

Now I can edit the index.css file to include Tailwind CSS directives and the CSS variables for shadcn/ui.

Now let me create the proper folder structure for the frontend and set up utility functions. I'll create:

1. Utils for cn (className merging)
2. Component directories
3. Types
4. Landing page components

Let me structure this properly.

✻ Thinking…

Let me create the proper folder structure for the frontend project.

Now let me create essential UI components that we'll need for the landing page. I'll start with Button and Card components which
are fundamental for any landing page.

✅ CSS Loading Issue Fixed!

The problem was that we were using Tailwind CSS v4.1.13 (which has a completely different configuration system) but our setup
was configured for Tailwind CSS v3. Here's what I fixed:

Root Cause & Solution:

1. Version Incompatibility

- Problem: Tailwind v4 uses a new configuration format that's incompatible with v3
- Solution: Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (stable, production-ready)

2. Missing PostCSS Configuration

- Problem: No postcss.config.js file to process Tailwind directives
- Solution: Created proper PostCSS configuration with Tailwind and Autoprefixer plugins

3. Build System Integration

- Problem: Vite wasn't processing CSS properly without PostCSS config
- Solution: Proper PostCSS + Tailwind integration now working

Evidence of Fix:

Before: CSS file was only 3.30 kB (missing styles)
After: CSS file is now 40.01 kB (includes all Tailwind utilities)

Build Results:
✓ dist/assets/index-Bth3kfUI.css 40.01 kB │ gzip: 6.91 kB
✓ dist/assets/index-DfTAb_xI.js 260.01 kB │ gzip: 78.61 kB

What's Now Working:

✅ Beautiful CSS Styling - All Tailwind classes properly applied
✅ Dark/Light Mode - System detection + toggle button✅ Theme-aware Components - Semantic colors adapt to theme
✅ Cross-browser Support - Enhanced with proper meta tags
✅ Production Build - Clean build with all styles included
✅ Development Server - Running on http://localhost:5173/

The landing page should now display with proper styling, beautiful gradients, responsive design, and full dark/light mode
support. The theme toggle button in the top-right allows you to test both modes instantly!
