Perfect! Now I understand the patterns:

1. Controller Pattern:

   - Uses asyncHandler wrapper
   - Logs request details
   - Uses Zod schema validation with .parse()
   - Calls service methods
   - Returns structured response with status and data

2. Service Pattern:

   - Uses class-based service with JSDoc
   - Business logic methods
   - Throws AppError for business logic errors
   - Returns data objects
   - Uses existing generateToken method

3. Validation Pattern:

   - Zod schemas with specific error messages
   - Email validation with .trim().toLowerCase()
   - Password complexity for registration (but login will just need basic validation)

4. JSDoc Pattern:

   - @param {Type} name - description
   - @returns {Promise<Type>} - description

Now let me implement the login functionality step by step, following these exact patterns.

Login

Implement Login Method in Auth Service

Now I need to add the login method to the AuthService class. Looking at the existing register method, I need to follow the same
pattern:

1. JSDoc comment with proper parameter and return documentation
2. Business logic for finding user and validating credentials
3. Use the user model's comparePassword method
4. Generate token using existing generateToken method
5. Return same structure as register method
6. Throw appropriate AppError for invalid credentials

‚è∫ Step 3: Add Login Controller Method

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the login controller method. Looking at the register controller, I need to:

1. Import the loginSchema from validators
2. Add a login controller method that follows the exact same pattern as register:

   - Uses asyncHandler wrapper
   - Logs request details
   - Uses loginSchema.parse() for validation
   - Calls authService.login()
   - Returns structured response with status 200 (successful login, not creation)

   I've added the login controller method following the exact same pattern as the register method:

3. ‚úÖ Imported loginSchema from validators
4. ‚úÖ Used asyncHandler wrapper
5. ‚úÖ Added debug logging for request details
6. ‚úÖ Used loginSchema.parse() for validation
7. ‚úÖ Called authService.login() with validated data
8. ‚úÖ Returned structured response with status 200 (for successful login)

Profile management

The user wants me to implement a complete profile management feature with CRUD operations. Let me think about this step by step:

1. Current Architecture Analysis: I need to understand what profile management should include and follow the exact same patterns as
   login/register.
2. Profile Management Requirements:

   - GET profile - retrieve current user's profile
   - PUT profile - update user profile
   - Possibly POST change-password as a separate endpoint

3. Security Considerations:

   - These should be protected routes requiring authentication
   - Users should only be able to access/modify their own profile
   - Password changes should be separate and require current password

4. What needs to be implemented:

   - Authentication middleware usage (already exists)
   - Profile validation schema
   - Profile service methods
   - Profile controller methods
   - Profile routes
   - Comprehensive testing
   - API documentation

5. Keep it minimal: Focus on core profile operations:

   - GET /api/v1/auth/profile (get current user profile)
   - PUT /api/v1/auth/profile (update name/email)
   - POST /api/v1/auth/change-password (change password)

6. Consistency: Follow exact same patterns as existing auth endpoints, same JSDoc style, same error handling, same response format.

Let me start by planning the implementation:

Step 1: Add validation schemas

- profileUpdateSchema for name/email updates
- changePasswordSchema for password changes

Step 2: Implement service methods

- getProfile() method
- updateProfile() method
- changePassword() method

Step 3: Implement controller methods

- getProfile controller
- updateProfile controller
- changePassword controller

Step 4: Add protected routes

- GET /profile (with auth middleware)
- PUT /profile (with auth middleware)
- POST /change-password (with auth middleware)

Step 5: Test all endpoints

I'll focus on comprehensive testing to ensure robust profile management functionality. This involves multiple test scenarios to
validate authentication, profile operations, and error handling. Key testing areas include verifying authentication requirements,
checking profile retrieval accuracy, validating update mechanisms, and ensuring secure password change processes. I'll create test
cases that cover both successful operations and potential error scenarios to guarantee the endpoint's reliability and security.

Step 6: Create comprehensive documentation
I'll systematically document the new profile management endpoints, ensuring clear explanation of each route's purpose, required
authentication, input parameters, and expected responses.

‚è∫ I'll implement a complete, robust, and secure Profile Management feature following the exact same architectural patterns as the
existing authentication system. Let me start by analyzing the requirements and planning the implementation.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Let me analyze the profile management requirements:

Profile Management CRUD Operations:

1. GET /api/v1/auth/profile - Get current user's profile (requires authentication)
2. PUT /api/v1/auth/profile - Update user profile (name, email) (requires authentication)
3. POST /api/v1/auth/change-password - Change password (requires current password + authentication)

Security Requirements:

- All endpoints must be protected with authentication middleware
- Users can only access/modify their own profile
- Password changes require current password verification
- Email updates should check for uniqueness
- Follow same validation patterns as registration

Architecture Consistency:

- Same JSDoc patterns
- Same error handling with AppError
- Same response format (status, data)
- Same validation with Zod
- Same service layer pattern
- Same controller pattern with asyncHandler

Let me start implementing step by step.

‚è∫ Profile Management Architecture Analysis

Based on the existing codebase patterns, I'll implement these secure profile endpoints:

- GET /api/v1/auth/profile - Get current user profile (authenticated)
- PUT /api/v1/auth/profile - Update user profile (name/email) (authenticated)
- POST /api/v1/auth/change-password - Change password (authenticated + current password)

Step 1: Add Profile Validation Schemas
Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the validation schemas for profile management. Based on the existing patterns, I'll add:

1. profileUpdateSchema - for updating name and email (similar to register schema but without password)
2. changePasswordSchema - for changing password (current password + new password with same complexity requirements)

Let me add these to the auth.validator.js file following the exact same patterns.

‚è∫ Read(src/validators/auth.validator.js)
‚éø Read 28 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I'll add the profile validation schemas. I need to add:

1. profileUpdateSchema - for updating name and email (reuse the same validation rules as register but without password)
2. changePasswordSchema - for changing password (current password + new password with full complexity)

I'll follow the exact same patterns and formatting as the existing schemas.

Implement Profile Service Methods

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the profile service methods to the auth.service.js file. I need to implement:

1. getProfile(userId) - get user profile by ID
2. updateProfile(userId, profileData) - update user profile (name, email)
3. changePassword(userId, passwordData) - change user password

I need to follow the exact same JSDoc patterns and error handling as the existing methods. Let me read the current auth.service.js
file first to understand the exact patterns.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! Now I understand the exact patterns. I need to add the profile methods following the same JSDoc style, error handling
patterns, and response format. Let me add the three profile methods:

1. getProfile(userId) - returns user profile without password
2. updateProfile(userId, profileData) - updates name/email with validation for email uniqueness
3. changePassword(userId, passwordData) - changes password after validating current password

I'll add these methods between the login method and the generateToken method to maintain logical organization.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I've implemented the three profile service methods following the exact same patterns as the existing code. Now I need to
move to Step 3 and add the controller methods.

‚è∫ Step 3: Add Profile Controller Methods

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the controller methods. I need to add:

1. getProfile - GET controller that uses req.user.id (from auth middleware)
2. updateProfile - PUT controller with validation
3. changePassword - POST controller with validation

Let me first read the current controller file to see the exact patterns and then add the new methods.

‚è∫ Read(src/controllers/auth.controller.js)
‚éø Read 41 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the controller methods. I'll follow the exact same patterns as the existing controllers. I need to:

1. Import the new validation schemas
2. Add the three controller methods following the same patterns
3. Use req.user.id (which will be set by the authentication middleware)

Let me add these controller methods.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Excellent! I've added the controller methods following the exact same patterns. Now I need to move to Step 4 and add the protected
routes to the auth.routes.js file.

‚è∫ Step 4: Add Protected Profile Routes

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to add the protected routes to the auth.routes.js file. I need to:

1. Import the new controller methods
2. Import the auth middleware (protect middleware)
3. Add the three new routes with authentication protection

Let me first check the current routes file and also look at the auth middleware to understand the protection pattern.

‚è∫ Read(src/routes/auth.routes.js)
‚éø Read 16 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Read(src/middleware/auth.middleware.js)
‚éø Read 32 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I can see that:

1. The auth middleware has a protect function that sets req.user with the authenticated user
2. The middleware uses the asyncHandler pattern just like the controllers
3. The user object is set to req.user with the password field excluded

Now I need to update the routes file to:

1. Import the new controller methods
2. Import the protect middleware
3. Add the three protected routes

Let me update the routes file.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I've added the protected routes. Now I need to move to Step 5 and test all the profile endpoints with authentication. Let
me first check if the server is still running and then test the endpoints.

‚è∫ Step 5: Test All Profile Endpoints with Authentication

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Now I need to test all the profile endpoints. First, let me check if the server is running, and then I'll need to:

1. First login to get a valid JWT token
2. Test GET /profile with authentication
3. Test PUT /profile with authentication
4. Test POST /change-password with authentication
5. Test all error scenarios (no auth, invalid auth, validation errors)

Let me start by checking the server status and then performing the tests.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Good, the server is running and has restarted several times due to our changes. Now I need to test the profile endpoints. Let me
start by:

1. First login to get a valid JWT token
2. Test each profile endpoint

Let me start with logging in to get a valid token.

‚è∫ Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v1/auth/login \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \‚Ä¶)
‚éø curl: option : blank argument where content is expected  
 curl: try 'curl --help' or 'curl --manual' for more information

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

I got a curl error. Let me try a simpler approach to login and get the token:

‚è∫ Bash(curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/v1/auth/login \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \‚Ä¶)
‚éø {  
 "status": "success",
"data": {
‚Ä¶ +13 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I got the JWT token: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiI2OGRhMzA3ODVjNGMwNmI4Y2Y5YTNkYjkiLCJpYXQiOjE3NTkx
MzMyMjQsImV4cCI6MTc1OTczODAyNH0.2-fpZNde0gQ_nMAz8P564yaGJ6rZQGAI_ljFkPbYTJ8

Now let me test all the profile endpoints:

1. Test GET /profile with valid token
2. Test GET /profile without token (should fail)
3. Test PUT /profile with valid data
4. Test PUT /profile with invalid data
5. Test POST /change-password with valid data
6. Test POST /change-password with wrong current password

Let me start testing these endpoints systematically.

‚è∫ Great! I got the JWT token. Now let me test all profile endpoints systematically:

Test 1: GET Profile with Valid Token
