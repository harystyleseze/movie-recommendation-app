‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

The user wants me to focus on implementing user features for the frontend while maintaining consistency. They've highlighted the
specific features they want:

1. Save favorite movies
2. Create custom watchlists
3. Rate and review movies
4. User profile management

They've also provided the key directory paths, suggesting I should work with both frontend and backend as needed.

Let me think deeply about this implementation:

1. Architecture Analysis

First, I need to understand what's already in place:

- I can see there's already an API service structure
- There are auth components (LoginPage, RegisterPage)
- The movie discovery system is already implemented
- I need to check what backend user endpoints already exist

2. Implementation Strategy

I should approach this systematically:

Phase 1: Extend API service with user features

- Add authentication management (login/logout state)
- Add user-specific endpoints (favorites, watchlists, ratings, profile)

Phase 2: Create reusable UI components

- User authentication context/provider
- Favorite button component
- Rating component
- Watchlist management components
- Profile management interface

Phase 3: Integrate with existing movie components

- Add favorite/watchlist buttons to MovieCard
- Add rating to MovieDetails
- Create dedicated user pages (Profile, Watchlists, etc.)

Phase 4: Navigation and routing

- Update navigation to include user features
- Add protected routes for authenticated features

3. Data Models I'll Need

interface User {
id: string;
email: string;
username: string;
name: string;
avatar?: string;
preferences?: UserPreferences;
}

interface UserPreferences {
favoriteGenres: string[];
language: string;
theme: 'light' | 'dark';
}

interface Watchlist {
id: string;
name: string;
description?: string;
movies: string[]; // imdbIDs
createdAt: string;
updatedAt: string;
}

interface MovieRating {
movieId: string;
rating: number; // 1-10
review?: string;
createdAt: string;
updatedAt: string;
}

I'll develop a comprehensive approach to implement these user-centric features. The key is creating a seamless, integrated
experience that allows users to personalize their movie exploration. I'll focus on building modular, reusable components that can
easily plug into the existing movie discovery system.

The implementation will prioritize user experience, ensuring that each feature - from saving favorites to writing reviews - feels
intuitive and well-integrated. I'll pay close attention to maintaining a consistent design language and interaction pattern across
all new user-related interfaces.

My strategy involves a phased rollout, starting with core functionality and progressively enhancing the user's ability to interact
with and personalize their movie experience. This approach will allow for iterative improvements and user feedback incorporation.

‚è∫ You're right, let me think deeply about implementing comprehensive user features while maintaining consistency with the
existing architecture. Let me first analyze what's already implemented and then build upon it systematically.

Thinking‚Ä¶

Based on the context provided, I need to continue implementing user features for the frontend. Looking at the todo list and the
conversation summary, I was in the process of analyzing existing authentication and backend user endpoints (first task is in
progress). The user wants me to implement comprehensive user features:

- Save favorite movies
- Create custom watchlists
- Rate and review movies
- User profile management

The user emphasized "Think deep" and "maintain consistency as usual" while keeping it minimal, usable, and robust.

From the system reminders, I can see that I've already read some Docker and frontend configuration files. Now I need to continue
with analyzing the existing authentication structure and backend endpoints to understand what's already implemented before building
the user features.

Let me start by checking the backend user endpoints and authentication structure, then examine the current API service to see what
user-related functionality already exists.

‚è∫ I'll continue analyzing the existing authentication and backend user endpoints to understand the current structure before
implementing the user features.

‚è∫ Read(backend/src/routes/auth.js)
‚éø Error reading file

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Let me find the auth routes - they might be organized differently. Let me check the backend structure first.

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "backend/\**/*auth\*")
‚éø Found 25 files (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Great! I can see there's a comprehensive authentication system already in place. Let me examine the key files to understand the
current structure:

1. Authentication routes
2. Authentication controller
3. User models/endpoints
4. Current API service structure

Let me start with these files in parallel.

‚è∫ Read(backend/src/routes/auth.routes.js)
‚éø Read 29 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Read(backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.js)
‚éø Read 98 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚è∫ Search(pattern: "backend/\**/*user\*")
‚éø Found 13 files (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I can see there's already a comprehensive authentication system and user profile functionality. Let me examine:

1. User model to understand the data structure
2. User profile routes and controller to see what user features might already exist
3. Current frontend API service to see what's already connected

Let me read these key files to understand the existing structure.

---

---

Perfect! Now I have a complete understanding of the backend API structure. The backend has comprehensive user features already
implemented:

Authentication & Profile:

- /api/v1/auth/register - Register
- /api/v1/auth/login - Login
- /api/v1/auth/profile - Get/Update profile
- /api/v1/profile/me - My profile
- /api/v1/profile/me/activity - My activity

Favorites:

- POST /api/v1/favorites - Add to favorites
- GET /api/v1/favorites - Get my favorites
- GET /api/v1/favorites/count - Get favorites count
- DELETE /api/v1/favorites/:movieId - Remove from favorites
- GET /api/v1/favorites/:movieId/status - Check favorite status
- GET /api/v1/favorites/recommendations - Get recommendations from favorites

Watchlists:

- POST /api/v1/watchlists - Create watchlist
- GET /api/v1/watchlists - Get my watchlists
- GET /api/v1/watchlists/:id - Get watchlist by ID
- PUT /api/v1/watchlists/:id - Update watchlist
- DELETE /api/v1/watchlists/:id - Delete watchlist
- POST /api/v1/watchlists/:id/movies - Add movie to watchlist
- DELETE /api/v1/watchlists/:id/movies/:movieId - Remove movie from watchlist
- PATCH /api/v1/watchlists/:id/movies/:movieId/watched - Update watched status

Ratings/Reviews:

- POST /api/v1/ratings - Add/update rating/review
- GET /api/v1/ratings - Get my ratings

- GET /api/v1/ratings/stats - Get my rating stats
- GET /api/v1/ratings/movie/:movieId - Get movie ratings
- GET /api/v1/ratings/movie/:movieId/my-rating - Get my rating for movie
- DELETE /api/v1/ratings/:id - Delete rating

I'll systematically extend the frontend API service to incorporate these new rating-related endpoints, ensuring comprehensive
authentication and data management.

‚è∫ Perfect! Now I have a complete picture of the backend API. The backend already has comprehensive user features implemented. Let
me extend the frontend API service to include authentication and all user-specific endpoints.
