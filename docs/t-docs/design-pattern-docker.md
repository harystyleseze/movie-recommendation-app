Thinkingâ€¦

The user wants me to dockerize both the frontend and backend applications with nginx as a reverse proxy. They want both development
(local setup) and production setups. They also mention CORS considerations and want to eventually set up CI/CD for Vercel
(frontend) and Render (backend).

Let me think about the structure:

1. Frontend (React/Vite):

   - Development: Vite dev server with hot reload
   - Production: Built static files served by nginx

2. Backend (Node.js/Express):

   - Development: Node with nodemon for hot reload
   - Production: Node with PM2 or similar

3. Nginx:

   - Reverse proxy to route requests
   - Handle CORS headers
   - Serve static files in production
   - Route API requests to backend

4. Docker Structure:

   - Dockerfile for frontend (dev and prod stages)
   - Dockerfile for backend (dev and prod stages)
   - Nginx Dockerfile with configuration
   - docker-compose.yml for development
   - docker-compose.prod.yml for production

5. CORS Considerations:

   - In development: Allow localhost origins
   - In production: Allow specific domains
   - Nginx can handle CORS headers
   - Backend should also have CORS configuration

6. CI/CD Preparation:

   - Docker images should be optimized
   - Environment variables properly configured
   - Build process should be efficient

Let me start implementing this step by step:

1. First, check the current backend structure
2. Create Dockerfiles for both services
3. Create nginx configuration
4. Create docker-compose files
5. Configure CORS properly
6. Test the setup

Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the project structure:

Backend:

- Node.js/Express application
- Dependencies: axios, bcryptjs, cors, dotenv, express, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, zod
- Development: nodemon with npm run dev
- Production: node with npm start
- Entry point: src/server.js

Frontend:

- React with Vite
- Dependencies: React 19.1.1, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Development: Vite dev server with npm run dev
- Production: Build with npm run build

Now let me start creating the Docker setup. I'll structure it properly with:

1. Backend Dockerfile (multi-stage for dev/prod)
2. Frontend Dockerfile (multi-stage for dev/prod)
3. Nginx configuration for reverse proxy
4. Docker-compose for development
5. Docker-compose for production
6. Environment configuration
7. CORS setup

Let me start with the backend Dockerfile.
