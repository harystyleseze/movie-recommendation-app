‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

The user wants me to implement a movie discovery API for the backend with the following requirements:

1. Search movies by title, genre, or year
2. Integration with external movie API (e.g., TMDB)
3. Follow the existing codebase architecture and design format
4. Keep it minimal, secure, and usable
5. Don't over-engineer the solution

Let me first examine the current codebase structure to understand the existing patterns and architecture.

I should:

1. Check the current backend structure
2. Look at existing controllers, services, routes patterns
3. Check the .env file for any existing API keys
4. Look at the movie controller file that was opened
5. Implement the TMDB integration following the existing patterns
6. Create the movie discovery endpoints

Let me start by examining the existing codebase structure and patterns.

‚è∫ I'll implement the movie discovery API following your existing codebase architecture. Let me first examine the current
structure and then implement TMDB integration.

Great! I can see the architecture. The codebase already has a movie controller and the basic structure is in place. Let me examine
what's already implemented:

1. The movie controller exists and has endpoints for:

   - searchMovies
   - discoverMovies
   - getMovieDetails
   - getGenres

2. It follows the pattern:

   - Controllers use asyncHandler for error handling
   - Zod schemas for validation
   - Services for business logic
   - Standard response format with status/data structure

3. The .env already has TMDB_API_KEY placeholder
4. The architecture follows:

   - src/controllers/ - route handlers
   - src/services/ - business logic
   - src/validators/ - input validation
   - src/models/ - database models
   - src/routes/ - route definitions

Let me check what's already implemented in the services and validators to see what I need to complete.

Interesting! It looks like the movie functionality is already partially implemented. I can see:

1. movie.service.js - business logic layer
2. tmdb.service.js - TMDB API integration layer
3. movie.validator.js - validation schemas
4. movie.routes.js - route definitions

Let me examine these files to see what's already implemented and what needs to be completed or improved.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Excellent! I can see that most of the movie discovery API is already implemented and follows best practices. Let me check the
routes and models to see what's completed:

1. ‚úÖ TMDB Service - Complete with proper error handling, axios configuration, search, discovery, details, genres
2. ‚úÖ Movie Service - Complete business logic layer that delegates to TMDB service
3. ‚úÖ Movie Controller - Complete with all endpoints
4. ‚úÖ Validators - Proper Zod schemas for validation

The architecture is very well designed and follows best practices:

- Separation of concerns (controller -> service -> external service)
- Proper error handling with custom AppError
- Input validation with Zod
- Async error handling with asyncHandler

Let me check the routes and models to complete my understanding, then see what needs to be done.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! The movie discovery API is already completely implemented and follows excellent architecture patterns. Let me check if the
routes are registered in the main app and if we need a TMDB API key to test it.

Looking at what's implemented:

‚úÖ Complete Implementation:

1. TMDB Service - External API integration with proper error handling
2. Movie Service - Business logic layer
3. Movie Controller - Request handlers with validation
4. Movie Routes - RESTful endpoints
5. Movie Model - MongoDB schema with indexes
6. Validators - Zod schemas for input validation

Available Endpoints:

1. GET /api/v1/movies/search - Search by title/keywords, with optional year filter
2. GET /api/v1/movies/discover - Filter by genre, year, rating, sort options
3. GET /api/v1/movies/:id - Get movie details by TMDB ID
4. GET /api/v1/movies/genres/all - Get all available genres

The only thing I need to check is:

1. If routes are registered in the main app
2. If we need to set up a real TMDB API key
3. Test the endpoints

Let me check these quickly.

‚è∫ Read(src/app.js)
‚éø Read 100 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Perfect! I can see that the movie routes are already registered in the app at line 82: app.use("/api/v1/movies", movieRoutes);

So the complete movie discovery API is already implemented! Let me update my todos and test the implementation. I need to:

1. Set up the TMDB API key
2. Test the endpoints to make sure they work

The architecture is excellent and follows all best practices:

- ‚úÖ Proper separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Error handling with custom AppError class
- ‚úÖ Input validation with Zod schemas
- ‚úÖ Async error handling with asyncHandler
- ‚úÖ RESTful API design
- ‚úÖ MongoDB model with proper indexes
- ‚úÖ External API integration with axios
- ‚úÖ Routes registered in main app

This is exactly what was requested - minimal, secure, and usable implementation following the existing codebase patterns.

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

Excellent! I discovered that the movie discovery API is already completely implemented and follows all the best practices you
requested. The implementation is:

‚úÖ Minimal - Clean, focused code without over-engineering
‚úÖ Secure - Proper error handling, input validation, and API key management‚úÖ Usable - RESTful endpoints with clear functionality
‚úÖ Follows codebase architecture - Matches existing patterns perfectly

Now I need to:

1. Set up a real TMDB API key (currently it's just a placeholder)
2. Test the endpoints

Let me set up the TMDB API key and then test the implementation.

‚è∫ Excellent discovery! The movie discovery API is already completely implemented and follows all the best practices you
requested. The codebase has:

‚úÖ Complete Implementation

Architecture follows your existing patterns perfectly:

- Controllers ‚Üí Handle requests with validation
- Services ‚Üí Business logic layer
- External Services ‚Üí TMDB API integration
- Models ‚Üí MongoDB schemas with indexes
- Validators ‚Üí Zod input validation
- Routes ‚Üí RESTful endpoints

üìö Available Endpoints

3. GET /api/v1/movies/:id - Get movie details by TMDB ID
4. GET /api/v1/movies/genres/all - Get all available genres

üîß Setup Required

Just need to add a real TMDB API key:
