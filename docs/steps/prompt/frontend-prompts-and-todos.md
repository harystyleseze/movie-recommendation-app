to do

The user wants me to work on the frontend of the movie recommendation app. They want me to:

1. Structure the folders properly in the frontend directory
2. Create a modern, responsive landing page called "moveere"
3. Set up shadcn/ui for components
4. Include specific sections (hero, value propositions, product overview, features, testimonials, pricing, CTA, footer)
5. Make it modern, professional, and optimized for mobile/desktop
6. Run build and test
7. Create documentation

Let me start by exploring the current frontend structure and then implement this step by step.

First, let me check the current frontend structure.

the entire landing page doesnt have any css to make the page beautiful and support light, dark mode, use default system mode.
page must support all browser type. the page should be attractive and beautiful too. Think, explore, brainstorm, and implement.
keep it minimal and usable/functional. the fewer the code changes the better. do not take shortcuts

✻ Thinking…

The user is pointing out that the landing page doesn't have proper CSS to make it beautiful, and it needs to support light/dark
mode with system preference detection. They want it to work across all browser types and be attractive. Let me check what's
currently happening with the CSS.

Looking at the previous implementation, I set up Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components, but I should check the current state of the
CSS and see if there are issues. The user mentions the page doesn't look beautiful, so there might be styling issues.

Let me check:

1. The current index.css file
2. The tailwind config
3. See if dark mode is properly configured
4. Check if the CSS is being loaded properly
5. Make sure the system prefers-color-scheme is working

I should also check what the dev server is showing and if there are any CSS loading issues.
